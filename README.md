Fullstack Web Portfolio carried out as a Final Project of the Argentina Program course. For the [FrontEnd](https://github.com/alvarodvc/FrontEnd-Portfolio), it is a single page application (SPA) made using FrontEnd technologies such as HTML, CSS, Angular and Bootstrap. And for the [BackEnd](https://github.com/alvarodvc/BackEnd-Portfolio) it is a REST API made using Java + Spring Boot technologies under the MVC model for logic and MySQL for data persistence.
